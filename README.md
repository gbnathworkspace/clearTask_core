Interaction Flow
1.	User Action: A user interacts with the frontend (e.g., submits a registration form).
2.	Frontend Request: The frontend component (e.g., Register component) calls a function from authService.ts (e.g., register).
3.	HTTP Request: The authService.ts function sends an HTTP request to the corresponding endpoint in AuthController.cs (e.g., POST /api/auth/register).
4.	Backend Processing: The AuthController.cs processes the request, performs the necessary actions (e.g., creating a new user), and returns a response.
5.	Frontend Response Handling: The authService.ts function receives the response and the frontend component updates the UI accordingly (e.g., displays a success message).
